We are organizing a computational ecology summer school in May 2016, near
Montréal. [Apply now][form], or read more about the program and venue below.

# Goals

The goal of this summer school is to give graduate students and early-career
scientists in ecology a basic training in computational skills. Over the
course of 40 hours of lessons, including students-led research projects,
we will cover:

- good practices for data management and scientific software
- useful tools from applied mathematics and statistics
- notions of parallel computing and tips for efficient code
- interaction with web-based data through APIs

# General informations

## Instructors

The summer school will be led by Timothée Poisot (Université de Montréal)
and Dominique Gravel (Université de Sherbrooke).

Timothée is an assistant professor in Quantitative and Computational
Ecology. He is a certified Software Carpentry instructor, and serves on the
editorial board of Methods in Ecology & Evolution and PLOS Computational
Biology. His research focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics of species
interactions, and the applications of graph theory to a variety of ecological
questions.

Dominique is a professor of biogeography at the Université de Sherbrooke,
and holds a Tier I Canada Research Chair. His research focuses on theoretical
ecosystem ecology, and notably the interactions between community structure,
ecosystem functioning, and species distributions.

## Venue

The summer school will take place at the [*Station de Biologie des
Laurentides*][sbl] (SBL), operated by the Université de Montréal. Situated
in the middle of a series of lakes, in the Laurentians, it is a very pleasant
and stimulating place to work and relax.

## Dates

The summer school will take place during the first week of May, 2016 (from
May 2, to May 8).

## Pre-requisites

It is expected that attendees will be familiar with programming, and have
a working knowledge of at least one programming language (`R`, `python`,
`perl`, ...). We will provide training in how to use the command line, and
how to work on remote machines, on day 1. We will provide one high-performance
computing server to work on, but students will have to bring their own laptops.

# Program

All days will follow the same template. Starting from an ecological problem,
we will discuss ways to solve it using computational tools, and in so doing
explore different programming approaches and practices.

At the end of the week, attendees will work on a series of projects, based
on empirical data. We do hope that these analyses will be continued when
the summer school is over, and eventually turn into new papers.

## Day 1: Best practices for scientific computing

- Introduction to the command line (shell, bash .... )
- Version control
- Unit testing, continuous integration

## Day 2: Code optimization

- Profiling
- Parallel and distributed computing
- Genetic Algorithms

## Day 3: Data management and analysis

- Introduction to databases
- Maximum Likelihood, Simulated Annealing

## Day 4: Computational statistics

- Bayesian statistics
- Approximate Bayesian Computation and inference from tiny data
- Computational macro-ecology and automated data synthesis

## Day 5: Open data

- Open data on the web, API, JSON
- Student-led projects on a dataset

## Day 6

- Student-led projects
- Presentations in the evening

## Day 7

- Students are welcome to stay at the *Station de Biologie des Laurentides*
for an additional day, to hike, canoe, or work.

# Registration

The registration fees are 60 CAD a day. This includes transportation, three
meals a day, and hosting. Please do indicate if you intend to stay on day
7. We will organize transportation to and from Montréal (exact location to
be announced).

Attendance is limited to 12 students. To apply, please fill in the following
form: [http://goo.gl/forms/wyoScdU2Ia][form]. Applications begin immediately
and selected applicants will be notified by the first week of March 2016 at
the latest.

[form]: http://goo.gl/forms/wyoScdU2Ia

Applicants that have completed a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop
will be given priority to attend.

If your application is selected, we ask that you pay in advance the first
two-days of the summer school, as a non-refundable deposit. Students affiliated
with the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences can contact the coordinator
to have their registration fee covered or reimbursed.
