<p class="lead text-primary" markdown="1">**Spatial ecology of species interactions**</p>

Why is there variation in the way species interact over space? We analyse
spatially and temporally replicated datasets of surveys of species interactions
to measure the variation in the structure of ecological networks, and
describe its spatial dynamics. This research reveals an important aspect of
the dissimilarity of ecological communities: the same species can interact
in different ways.

<p class="lead text-primary" markdown="1">**Predictive approaches of network structure**</p>

Can we predict inter-specific interactions? We are interested in developing
predictive models that would use different sources of information (functional
traits, local abundances, previous knowledge, ...) to predict the probability
that two species will interact. These models are required to forecast the
structure of novel communities that will emerge through global changes.

<p class="lead text-primary" markdown="1">**Numerical toolkits for network analysis**</p>

Addressing these new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open source software to make network analysis user-friendly. We also
contribute to the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) project, an open database
of species interactions and associated packages.

<p class="lead text-primary" markdown="1">**Functional consequences of network structure**</p>

We are interested in turning the structure of networks into a predictive
variable for community ecology. We are particularly interested in the
relationship between network structure and ecosystem functioning.
