# Spatial ecology of species interactions

Why is there variation in the way species interact over space? We analyse
spatially and temporally replicated datasets of surveys of species interactions
to measure the variation in the structure of ecological networks, and
describe its spatial dynamics. This research reveals an important aspect of
the dissimilarity of ecological communities: the same species can interact
in different ways.

# Synthetic datasets and open ecological data

We believe that open data are a treasure trove of knowledge that has not been
entirely used yet. We are working on understanding the type of problems that
we can solve without having to do new sampling, and how to handle errors
and uncertainty. As a bonus, we use the tools we develop to improve the
monitoring and reporting abilities of various stakeholders.

# Predictive approaches of network structure

Can we predict inter-specific interactions? We are interested in developing
predictive models that would use different sources of information (functional
traits, local abundances, previous knowledge, ...) to predict the probability
that two species will interact. These models are required to forecast the
structure of novel communities that will emerge through global changes.

# Numerical toolkits for network analysis

Addressing these new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open source software to make network analysis user-friendly. We also
contribute to the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) project, an open database of
species interactions and associated packages.

# Functional consequences of network structure

We are interested in turning the structure of networks into a predictive
variable for community ecology. We are particularly interested in the
relationship between network structure and ecosystem functioning, but also work
on landscape connectivity, and the transmission of both ideas and diseases.
