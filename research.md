# Spatial ecology of species interactions

Why is there variation in the way species interact over space? We analyse
spatially and temporally replicated datasets of surveys of species interactions
to measure the variation in the structure of ecological networks, and
describe its spatial dynamics. This research reveals an important aspect of
the dissimilarity of ecological communities: the same species can interact
in different ways.

# Predictive approaches of network structure

Can we predict inter-specific interactions? We are interested in developing
predictive models that would use different sources of information (functional
traits, local abundances, previous knowledge, ...) to predict the probability
that two species will interact. These models are required to forecast the
structure of novel communities that will emerge through global changes.
