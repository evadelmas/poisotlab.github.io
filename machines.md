# Machines

All our machines run some version of Fedora. Their names come from female
scientists that have been pioneers in computer sciences or applied mathematics.

## Desktops

- `grete` ([Grete Hermann][grete]; foundations for computerized algebra) -- 12 i7 cores, 64G RAM, nVidia card for GP-GPU
- `margaret` ([Margaret Hamilton][margaret]; coined the term "software engineering") -- 12 i7 cores, 64G RAM

## Laptops

- `grace` ([Grace Hopper][grace]; invented the first compiler) -- A Dell XPS13. The lab's shared laptop, adorned with many stickers.
- `adele` ([Adele Goldberg][adele]; contributed tyo Smalltalk-80) -- Lenovo Carbon X1. It's Tim's. You can't touch it.

## Servers

- `ada` ([Ada Lovelace][ada]; first computer programmer) -- 48 Intel Xeon cores, 256G RAM. Oh yeah.
- `hedy` ([Hedy Lamarr][hedy]; developed technology now used for wifi) -- the little Raspberry PI that could (print, through `lp` and `ssh`).
