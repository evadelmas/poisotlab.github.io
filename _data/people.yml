- name: Timothée Poisot
  pi: yes
  id: tim
  mugshot: tim.jpg
  blurb: is a computational ecologist, focused on understanding how and why species interactions vary over space and time. He uses network approaches, and is easily excited by methodology. Tim is a member of the [Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences][qcbs], rants about open science on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tpoi), has a [blog](https://medium.com/@tpoi/), and is on [github](https://github.com/tpoisot/) too.

- name: Mathilde Besson
  current: yes
  id: mathe
  mugshot: mathildebesson.jpg
  blurb: is a PhD candidate with Tim and Dominique Gravel. She works on local adaptation in meta-communities, and how it shapes ecosystem functions. Her research uses modelling and experimental evolution with a bacteria-phage system.

- name: Eva Delmas
  current: yes
  id: eva
  mugshot: evadelmas.jpg
  blurb: is a PhD student with Tim and [Daniel Stouffer][stouffer]. Her research project deals with understanding how food web structure can be used to predict ecosystem functioning and biomass fluxes across ecosystems, and how species functional roles predict their contribution to ecosystem functions.

- name: Cynthia Guéveneux-Julien
  current: yes
  id: cynthia
  mugshot: cynthiagueveneuxjulien.png
  blurb: is an Honor's student working on the planification, management, and restoration of landscape connectivity in the Laurentian mountains. She previously worked on the biogeography of host-parasite interactions.

- name: Daphnée Lecours-Tessier
  current: yes
  id: daphnee
  mugshot: daphneelecourstessier.jpg
  blurb: is an undergraduate research assistant, working on establishing best practices to connect the landscape to the limnoscape in order to maintain and restore habitat connectivity.

- name: The raccoon
  current: yes
  id: raccoon
  mughsot: raccoon.jpg
  blurbl: is our spirit animal. Muche like him, we thrive of people's leftover (data), spend a lot of time cleaning them, and will absolutely seize any data left unattended. None of us are actual raccoons (that you know of).

- name: Philippe Desjardins-Proulx
  current: yes
  id: phdp
  mugshot: philippedesjardinsproulx.jpg
  blurb: is a PhD student with Tim and [Dominique Gravel][dom]. His research focuses on applying machine learning and deep transfer knowledge to solve complicated ecological problems of all sorts, and he has more informations about it on his [website](http://phdp.github.io/). He talks about Haskell too much on [twitter](https://twitter.com/phdpqc/), and does thing in esoteric programming languages on [github](https://github.com/phdp/).

- name: Renaud McKinnon
  former: yes
  id: renaud
  mugshot: renaudmckinnon.png
  blurb: completed his MSc with Tim, [Dominique Gravel][dom] and [Steven Kembel][skemb]. His research focused on interactions between trees from experimental plantations and their microbial ectosymbionts, to understand how different levels of biodiversity (interactions, functional traits, taxonomy) shape ecosystem functioning.

- name: Charles Cusson
  former: yes
  id: charles
  mugshot: generic.png
  blurb: worked on the development of a better, more responsive interface for the [mangal.io](http://www.mangal.io) database. In particular, his work resulted in providing more meta-data when viewing the data on the website.

- name: Amélie Muller
  former: yes
  id: ameliemuller
  mugshot: ameliemuller.jpg
  blurb: was a master's student from Strasbourg University, doing a 6-months research stay in the group. Her work focused on understanding how interactions with pollinators contribute to the persistence of plants at different spatial scales, and how management programs could gain from relying on the variability of interactions.
