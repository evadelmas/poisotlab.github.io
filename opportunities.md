<div class="pure-u-1 copy" markdown="1"> If you are interested in theoretical
approaches to community ecology and biogeography, want to work in a dynamic
department, and are not afraid of inter-disciplinary approaches, then we
offer a research environment where you will be able to pursue your scientific
interests and learn new skills. Experience in mathematics or programming is
a good thing, but not a requirement.

Master's

: We are looking for two masters students, to work on the (i) the development

and (ii) develop an experimental and theoretical approach to the consequence
of local adaptation on ecosystem functioning under climate change. Starting
date of both projects: spring 2015.

PhD

: We are looking for one PhD candidate to develop new predictive approaches
for ecological interactions, by integrating functional traits and local
abundances. This project will involve experimental work on pitcher plants
