<div class="pure-u-1 copy" markdown="1"> If you are interested in theoretical
approaches to community ecology and biogeography, want to work in a dynamic
department, and are not afraid of inter-disciplinary approaches, then we
offer a research environment where you will be able to pursue your scientific
interests and learn new skills. Experience in mathematics or programming is
a good thing, but not a requirement.
