# How to apply?

If you are interested in theoretical approaches to community ecology and
biogeography, want to work in a dynamic department, and are not afraid of
inter-disciplinary approaches, then we offer a research environment where you
will be able to pursue your scientific interests and learn new skills.
Experience in mathematics or programming is a good thing, but not a requirement.

To apply, send Timoth√©e (`tim@poisotlab.io`) a single PDF with your CV, a
one-page summary of your career aspirations and outline of your motivation and
past experience, and contact information of two references.

# Current opportunities

## MSc

We have available funding for a MSc candidate, for up to two years. There is no
designated topic of research. If you are interested, have a look at our
[research interests](/research/) and [selected publications](/papers/), and
contact Tim to discuss potential subjects. Although we have a strong
computational side to all our research, there are opportunities to do
field-based science. If you are interested in molecular approaches in community
ecology, we have a *very* exciting project starting soon.

## Other opportunities

There are currently no other funded opportunities. If you have your own funding,
or are interested in looking for external funding, you are invited to get in
touch, and we can work on defining a research project that matches your
interests.
