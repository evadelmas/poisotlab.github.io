# How to apply?

If you are interested in theoretical approaches to community ecology and
biogeography, want to work in a dynamic department, and are not afraid of
inter-disciplinary approaches, then we offer a research environment where you
will be able to pursue your scientific interests and learn new skills.
Experience in mathematics or programming is a good thing, but not a requirement.

To apply, send Timoth√©e (`tim@poisotlab.io`) a single PDF with your CV, a
one-page summary of your career aspirations and outline of your motivation and
past experience, and contact information of two references.
