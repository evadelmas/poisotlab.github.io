We are organizing a summer school in data-driven ecological synthesis,
with support from the [Canadian Institute of Ecology & Evolution][ciee].

You can [apply on-line][form], or read the description below. Enrollment is
limited to 20 students. The class will run from May 1 to May 7, near Montréal.

You can download and print the [flyer][flyer].

# Goals

The main goal of this summer school is to give early-career ecologists the
tools they need to interact with open data, and use them to ask general
questions. In particular, we will discuss how diverse data can be integrated
to further ecological synthesis and analysis.

Over the course of seven days, including students-led projects to be continued
after the class, we will cover:

- good practices for data management
- useful statistical and mathematical tools
- data cleaning and data analysis tools
- notions of parallel computing for fast data processing
- data visualisation and presentation
- ensuring reproducibility of analyses

# General informations

## Instructors

The summer school will be led by Timothée Poisot (Université de Montréal),
with assistance from Dominique Gravel (Université de Sherbrooke) and guest
appearances by other local ecologists. Depending on the attendance, one or
two helper instructors will be here.

Timothée is an assistant professor in Quantitative and Computational
Ecology. He is a certified Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor,
and serves on the editorial board of Methods in Ecology & Evolution and PLOS
Computational Biology. His research focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics
of species interactions, and the applications of graph theory to a variety
of ecological questions.

Dominique is a professor of biogeography at the Université de Sherbrooke,
and holds a Tier I Canada Research Chair. His research focuses on theoretical
ecosystem ecology, and notably the interactions between community structure,
ecosystem functioning, and species distributions.

## Venue

The summer school will take place at the [*Station de Biologie des
Laurentides*][sbl] (SBL), operated by the Université de Montréal. Situated
in the middle of a series of lakes, in the Laurentians, it is a very pleasant
and stimulating place to work and relax. The SBL is also a perfect example
of an emblematic Canadian biome, sitting at the transition zone between the
urbanized Greater Montréal area and the Canadian shield.

## Dates

The summer school will take place during the first week of May, 2017 (from
May 1, to May 7).

## Transport

We will take care of the transportation from the Université de Montréal
to the field station on the morning on May 1, and from the field station to
the Université de Montréal on the afternoon of May 7. Further details will
be given to the selected applicants.

## Pre-requisites

We expect that the attendees are able to turn the computer on, or willing
to learn how to do so. We will take care of the rest from here. A passing
knowledge of statistics, and a programming languages, is good but not required.

# Program

All days will follow the same template -- we will have a more formal
introduction in the morning, with time for exercises; applications in the
afternoon; finally, short research seminars, round table discussions, and
bonfires in the evening.

## Day 1 - introduction

- transportation to the station
- what is ecological synthesis, what is data management
- discussion of participants expectations
- illustration of some research projects

## Day 2 -- data formats and data cleaning

- OpenRefine for data cleaning
- JSON, CSON, tsv, csv, xlsx, and all that
- merging, reshaping, and combining data

## Day 3 -- API and open data

- introduction to web-based API
- automated data download

## Day 4 -- introduction to databases

- sqlite
- import/export from tables to databases

## Day 5 -- analysing large amounts of data

- parallel processing
- optimization
- managing memory issues

## Days 6, 7 -- students projects

- student-led research projects

# Registration

The registration fees are 227.50 CAD for UdeM or CRÉPUQ students, and 692
CAD for other students. We have some funding for travel grants, please answer
the relevant questions in the [application form][form].

Selected applicants will be notified by the first week of March 2017.
