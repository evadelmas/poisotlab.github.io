**Why do species interact?** We study ecological interactions, their variation
through space and time, and their consequences on ecosystem properties. We use
numerical methods, computational tools, and close collaboration with empiricists
to address these questions.

You can read more about [our research](research), [who we are](people), or learn
about [current opportunities](opportunities). Oh, and we also [publish some papers](papers).
