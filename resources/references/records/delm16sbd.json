  "abstract": "Food webs are the backbone upon which biomass flows through ecosystems. Dynamical models of biomass can reveal how the structure of food webs is involved in many key ecosystem properties, such as persistence, stability, etc.. In this contribution, we present befwm , an implementation of the bio-energetic model, in the high-performance computing language Julia. We illustrate how this package can be used to conduct numerical experiments in a reproducible and standard way.",
