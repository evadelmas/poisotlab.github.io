We create cool tools for computational ecology! Here is a list, along with links to the *GitHub* projects.

# R packages

[PACO](https://github.com/PoisotLab/paco) implements procrustes analysis of co-phylogenetic signal.

[LP-BRIM](https://github.com/PoisotLab/lpbrim) is a way to find modules in large networks.

[betalink](https://github.com/PoisotLab/betalink) provides measures of network beta-diversity.

# Julia packages

[ProbaNet.jl](https://github.com/PoisotLab/ProbaNet.jl) provides probabilistic measures of network structure.

[Brim.jl](https://github.com/PoisotLab/Brim.jl) is a fast implementation of various modularity optimization routines.
