title: Measures of probabilistic networks

Our paper (with [The Stouffer Lab](http://www.stoufferlab.org/)) on new measures
for the structure of probabilistic networks has been accepted by *Methods in
Ecology & Evolution*. We describe usual network measures in the context where
interactions are quantified as a probability, rather than a 0/1 event.

There is also a `Julia` package to do most of the analyses presented in the
paper, which you can install using `Pkg.add("EcologicalNetwork")`. There is a
documentation and user guide [online][rtd] too.

Meanwhile, you can read a preprint of the accepted version using the link below.
