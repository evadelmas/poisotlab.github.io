The preprint of our *really cool* article on guidelines for the storage of
digitial data is now online at *PeerJ Preprints*. This is yet another paper
written by co-authors that have virtually never met each other. [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/index.html) played a great role in
making this paper happen.
