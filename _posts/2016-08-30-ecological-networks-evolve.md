Daniel Stouffer and I released a preprint with some (we think) really cool
results on the evolution of ecological bipartite networks. Using Approximate
Bayesian Computation, we figured out some evolutionary rules for the
evolutionary persistence of interactions that allow to reproduce the structure
of extant networks.
