<img src="/mugshots/tim.jpg" class="mugshot"/> **Timothée Poisot** is a computational
ecologist, focused on understanding how and why species interactions
vary over space and time. He uses network approaches, and is
easily excited by methodology. Tim is a member of the [Québec
Centre for Biodiversity Sciences][qcbs], rants about open science on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/tpoi), has a [website](http://timotheepoisot.fr/),
and is on [github](http://github.com/tpoisot/) too.

<img src="/mugshots/cynthiagueveneuxjulien.png" class="mugshot"/> **Cynthia
Guéveneux-Julien** is a summer student working on the spatial dissimilarity of
host-parasite interactions at the continental scale. Her project is to determine
how the structure and dissimilarity of networks varies at the margin of species
distributions, and to identify which environmental variables are driving this
variation.

<img src="/mugshots/ameliemuller.jpg" class="mugshot"/> **Amélie Muller** is a master's
student from Strasbourg University, doing a 6-months research stay in the group.
Her work is centered on understanding how interactions with pollinators
contribute to the persistence of plants at different spatial scales, and how
management programs could gain from focusing on the variability of interactions.

<img src="/mugshots/philippedesjardinsproulx.jpg" class="mugshot"/> **Philippe
Desjardins-Proulx** is a PhD student with Tim and [Dominique Gravel][dom]. His
research focuses on applying machine learning and deep transfer knowledge to
solve complicated ecological problems of all sorts, and he has more informations
about it on his [website](http://phdp.github.io/). He talks about Haskell too
much on [twitter](http://twitter.com/phdpqc/), and does thing in esoteric
programming languages on [github](http://github.com/phdp/).

### Former lab members

<img src="/mugshots/renaudmckinnon.png" class="mugshot"/> **Renaud Mc Kinnon**
completed his MSc student with Tim, [Dominique Gravel][dom] and [Steven
Kembel][skemb]. His research focused on interactions between trees from
experimental plantations and their microbial ectosymbionts, to understand how
different levels of biodiversity (interactions, functional traits, taxonomy)
shape ecosystem functioning.
