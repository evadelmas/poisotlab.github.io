## Tim

<img src="/mugshots/tim.jpg" class="mugshot"/> Tim is a computational
ecologist, focused on understanding how and why species interactions
vary over space and time. He uses network approaches, and is
easily excited by methodology. Tim is a member of the [Québec
Centre for Biodiversity Sciences][qcbs], rants about open science on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/tpoi), has a [website](http://timotheepoisot.fr/),
and is on [github](http://github.com/tpoisot/) too.

## Philippe Desjardins-Proulx

<img src="/mugshots/philippedesjardinsproulx.jpg" class="mugshot"/> Philippe
is a PhD student with Tim and [Dominique Gravel][dom]. His research focuses
on applying machine learning and deep transfer knowledge to solve complicated
ecological problems of all sorts, and he has more informations about it on
his [website](http://phdp.github.io/). He talks about Haskell too much on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/phdpqc/), and does thing in esoteric programming
languages on [github](http://github.com/phdp/).

## Amélie Muller

<img src="/mugshots/ameliemuller.jpg" class="mugshot"/> Amélie is a master's
student from Strasbourg University, doing a 6-months research stay in the group.
Her work is centered on understanding how interactions with pollinators
contribute to the persistence of plants at different spatial scales, and how
management programs could gain from focusing on the variability of interactions.

## Renaud Mc Kinnon

<img src="/mugshots/renaudmckinnon.png" class="mugshot"/> Renaud is a MSc
student with Tim, [Dominique Gravel][dom] and [Steven Kembel][skemb]. He
uses the interactions between trees from experimental plantations and their
microbial ectosymbionts to understand how different levels of biodiversity
(interactions, functional traits, taxonomy) interact to shape ecosystem
functioning.
